--- The rules ---
1) No previews - of either results or assets!
2) Stay in this editor at all times
3) No measurement tools
4) Stop coding when the time's up
5) After the round is over, press "Finish" and follow the prompt instructions to see your results

Good luck and most important of all; have fun!

NOTE TO ORGANIZERS (REMOVE ME):
  * INCLUDE PATHS TO ANY ASSETS THE PAGE MIGHT NEED HERE

  * THE BASE PATH WHEN VIEWING RESULTS IS /assets, SO YOU DON'T NEED TO INCLUDE THAT IN THE PATHS BELOW
